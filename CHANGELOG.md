## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton: npm workspaces, TypeScript project references, ESLint, Prettier, commit-message
  rules and a CI check job.
- `apps/hermie`, an Expo SDK 54 app targeting iOS, iPadOS, Android and macOS, with the compact and
  regular shells, design tokens, theming and the platform storage abstractions.
- A hand-maintained macOS project built on react-native-macos, with Expo modules linked through
  CocoaPods.
- `@hermes/shared`: the Hermes protocol sources, vendored from a pinned upstream commit by
  `scripts/sync-hermes-shared.mjs`. The rewrites are asserted, `--check` fails on drift, and the
  upstream tests are vendored with the sources and run unchanged.
- `@hermie/gateway-client`: a React-free client for a Hermes gateway — URL and header handling, the
  unauthenticated probe, native PKCE with a token coordinator that keeps refreshes single-flight,
  session-token and PKCE credential providers, an HTTP layer that retries once after a 401, a dial
  plan socket factory, and the connection state machine over one long-lived JSON-RPC client.
- `@hermie/fake-gateway`: a gateway stand-in for tests and offline development, with a CLI behind
  `npm run fake-gateway`.
- A hidden developer screen at Settings → Connection test that probes an address and opens a real
  connection to it, reachable through a Settings link in the compact shell's header.
- Architecture decision records 0001 to 0005, a glossary, platform notes and a gateway runbook.
