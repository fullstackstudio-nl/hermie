/**
 * `hermie-web --push`: the thing that is awake when nobody is looking.
 *
 * [ADR-0017](../../../../docs/adr/0017-push-through-hermie-web.md) in one
 * paragraph: an app that is not running has no socket — iOS suspends it within
 * seconds of backgrounding and Android's Doze does the equivalent — so
 * something that is always running has to watch, and it has to be something the
 * owner already runs. This process already sits next to the gateway, so it is
 * the one.
 *
 * This file owns the LIFECYCLE and nothing else: one connection, the state file
 * around it, and a clean stop. What to notify about is `watcher.ts`, how to
 * reach a device is `expo.ts` and `web-push.ts`, and who asked to be told is
 * `registrations.ts`.
